# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 13, 2018
#### Basic Setup

**Today's Progress**: Formulated some goals for the challenge, setup Leiningen, tested Spacemacs with Cider, played a bit with the REPL, solved Project Euler Problem 1 (even with a test).

**Thoughts:** Project setup with Leiningen is a breeze and really accessible for an absolute beginner of that toolchain. I always loved Spacemacs but Spacemace as a Clojure environment is really cool.  
Knowing some functional concepts like `map, filter, reduce` is a big plus when it comes to the math problems in Project Euler.


### Day 1: September 14, 2018
#### Recursion

**Today's Progress:** As I dove into Project Euler 002 (which is about Fibonacci) I had to read a lot about the way one does recursion in Clojure as it is not tail call optimized by default.  
I learned about a few ways how to do Fibonacci in Clojure.

**Thoughts:** I am pretty shocked in how different the performance of the different techiques can be.  
I have to do a lot of further reading on 
* `loop`
* `recur`
* `memoize`
as I'm not really getting it atm. The language is really pretty though.
