# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 13, 2018
#### Basic Setup

**Today's Progress**: Formulated some goals for the challenge, setup Leiningen, tested Spacemacs with Cider, played a bit with the REPL, solved Project Euler Problem 1 (even with a test).

**Thoughts:** Project setup with Leiningen is a breeze and really accessible for an absolute beginner of that toolchain. I always loved Spacemacs but Spacemace as a Clojure environment is really cool.  
Knowing some functional concepts like `map, filter, reduce` is a big plus when it comes to the math problems in Project Euler.
