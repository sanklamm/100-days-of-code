# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 13, 2018
#### Basic Setup

**Today's Progress**: Formulated some goals for the challenge, setup Leiningen, tested Spacemacs with Cider, played a bit with the REPL, solved Project Euler Problem 1 (even with a test).

**Thoughts:** Project setup with Leiningen is a breeze and really accessible for an absolute beginner of that toolchain. I always loved Spacemacs but Spacemace as a Clojure environment is really cool.  
Knowing some functional concepts like `map, filter, reduce` is a big plus when it comes to the math problems in Project Euler.


### Day 1: September 14, 2018
#### Recursion

**Today's Progress:** As I dove into Project Euler 002 (which is about Fibonacci) I had to read a lot about the way one does recursion in Clojure as it is not tail call optimized by default.  
I learned about a few ways how to do Fibonacci in Clojure.

**Thoughts:** I am pretty shocked in how different the performance of the different techiques can be.  
I have to do a lot of further reading on 
* `loop`
* `recur`
* `memoize`
as I'm not really getting it atm. The language is really pretty though.

### Day 2: September 15, 2018
#### 4Clojure exercises

**Today's Progress:** Did the first 20 4Clojure exercises.

**Thoughts:** I thought it would be better to nail down the language fundamentals than dive straight into harder problems. Yesterdays Fibonacci Problem was more guessing than informed programming. Which leads to not very much.
